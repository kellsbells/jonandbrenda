        <h3>About the Bride and Groom</h3>
        <p>Brenda and Jon met when they were about 14 years old as they both attended the same church and youth group activities. Jon thought Brenda had a cute "duck tail" (a short haircut) and she thought he was definitely the cutest boy there. Because of their age and teenage awkwardness, this remained as a simple, and one of many crushes. Brenda moved and that was the end of that.</p>
        <p>In August 2007, about 6 yrs later, they ran into each other again at a church activity. Any of their close friends can tell you that neither of them tend to go to these particular activities but this day, Brenda felt she should go and Jon was dragged to go by his good friends. There were definitely no sparks and in fact, she ignored him. Somehow a day or two later they began talking, a week later had already gone on a semi date. Brenda left for school soon but the two became the best of friends over the phone. The rest is history but certainly some of the most important years of their lives. Even while apart for two years with no communication but email while the two served a mission for the church in Utah and the Philippines, Brenda and Jon grew in their love for one another and are excited to take on this new journey.</p>
